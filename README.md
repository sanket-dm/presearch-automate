# A script for automating presearch seaches to get PRE tokens

No additional steps required, just download and run using a Python Interpreter!

Now including usage of random words from internet in search string, so no need for manual search terms!

This script is also able to search different queries in the different browsers, making it truly random (apart from ip address :S)

Currently it picks randomly from a list of 150 random words for a set of 6 browsers. For not straining the RAM and CPU, it searches on 2 sets of 3 browsers at a time.

## Note:
Please install the package ```random_word``` using the command ```pip install random_word```, ```pip install requests``` and ```pip install PyYAML``` before use.

## Currently works for: 
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Brave
* Edge - Beta
* Edge - Dev
* Edge - Canary
