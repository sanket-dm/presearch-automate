# A script for automating presearch seaches to get PRE tokens

No additional steps required, just download and run using a Python Interpreter!

Now including usage of random words from internet in search string, so no need for manual fiddling around!

This script is also able to search different queries in the different browsers, making it truly random (apart from ip address :P)

Currently it picks randomly from a list of 100 words for a set of 3 browsers. If you want more, you can extend it.

## Note:
Please install the package ```random_word``` using the command ```pip install random_word``` and ```pip install PyYAML``` before use.

## Currently works for: 
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Brave
* Edge - Beta
* Edge - Dev
* Edge - Canary
